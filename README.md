# SparkFund---EDA

Description of the project done:

I have done an EDA on the Spark Fund an asset management company. I have uploaded three jupyter notebooks in order to carry the task smoothly. Part 1 and Part 2 of the 
notebook consist of data cleaning. Part 3 of the notebook is the final analysis done. The problem statement along with the business objectives is given below. Also I 
have provided the necessary files required for the analysis in this section below.


Problem Statement:

1. Objective: You work for Spark Funds, an asset management company. Spark Funds wants to make investments in a few companies. The CEO of Spark Funds wants to understand
the global trends in investments so that she can take the investment decisions effectively.

2. Business and Data Understanding :
Spark Funds has two minor constraints for investments:

- It wants to invest between 5 to 15 million USD per round of investment

- It wants to invest only in English-speaking countries because of the ease of communication with the companies it would invest in. For the analysis, consider a country
to be English speaking only if English is one of the official languages in that country

3. Business objective:
The objective is to identify the best sectors, countries, and a suitable investment type for making investments. The overall strategy is to invest where others are 
investing, implying that the 'best' sectors and countries are the ones 'where most investors are investing'. (Spark Funds wants to invest where most other investors are
investing. This pattern is often observed among early stage startup investors.


Descriptions of the files: The companies file gives the information of the companies, rounds file gives the idea of funding rounds done by the companies and mapping file helps in the sectoral analysis.
